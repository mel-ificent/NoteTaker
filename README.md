# Note Taker

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

## Description
This application allows users to add notes, view existing notes, and delete notes.  The program makes API calls to the backend storage files to retrieve existing notes so once a user saves a note it will remain available until the user decides to delete it.

Highlights for this project:
- Use of Express.js to create a server and API calls to retrieve note related data
- Modularization of API routes to create clean file structure
- Use of fs and util packages to read, write, append, and delete data from the backend files
- Heroku to showcase the application

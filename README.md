# Note Taker

![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

## Description
This application allows users to add notes, view existing notes, and delete notes.  The program makes API calls to the backend storage files to retrieve existing notes so once a user saves a note it will remain available until the user decides to delete it.

Highlights for this project:
- Use of Express.js to create a server and API calls to retrieve note related data
- Modularization of API routes to create a clean file structure
- Use of fs and util packages to read, write, append, and delete data from the backend files
- Heroku to showcase the application

On the Note Taker page, a user can update the title and text of a note.  Once they have done so, a save icon will become available in the upper right corner to allow the user to save their note.

A user can then select any previously saved note listed on the left side to review the details.  At that point they can click the + sign in the top right corner to add another new note.

If a user wants to delete a note, they can click on the trashcan icon next to the note they wish to delete.  This will remove the note and the page will be updated to reflect the deletion.
